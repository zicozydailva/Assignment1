  <h3>1. Creating a web page</h3>
  <br>
  This page was typed by hand. Anybody can do this, you don't need any special "web creation" tools or HTML editors, and the pages you make can be viewed from any browser. To see how this page was made, choose View Source (or View Page Source, or View Document Source) in your browser's menu (or — in at least Chrome and Firefox — Ctrl-U on your keyboard). A simple web page like this one is just plain text with HTML commands (markup) mixed in. HTML commands (properly called "tags") themselves are plain text.
When you're just learning and want to experiment, you can do everything on your PC. Create a new directory ("folder") for your website, and then put the web-page files (HTML plus any pictures) in it. Use NotePad or other plain-text editor (not word processor) on your PC to create an index.html file, which you can view locally with your Web browser. (You can also use word processors such as Word or WordPad if you save in "plain text", "text", "text document", or "text document MS-DOS format".) <a href="#">Later</a> I'll explain how you can install your web site on the Internet. <br>

<i> Example for windows:</i> <br>
<dd>
Move your mouse cursor to the desktop. Right-click, choose New, then choose Folder, and a "New Folder" appears, with its name highlighted. Type "Web" to change the folder's name to Web (or anything else you want). Then start NotePad to create your first Web page.
</dd>
<br>

<h3>2. HTML Syntax</h3>
<p>
    Web pages are written in Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML). HTML has three special characters: <, &, >. An HTML command is enclosed in <...>, for example <p>, which is a paragraph separator, or <b> ("begin bold") and </b> ("end bold"). So the following HTML text:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>
    This sentence conatin &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; text;
  </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>

  produces:

<p>
  <blockquote>
    This sentence contains <strong>bold</strong>
<p>
    A Web page starts with a series of HTML  commands, and ends with a few more. The contents go in between:
   <pre>
     &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
     &lt;html lang "en"&gt;
     &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;META charaset="UTF"&gt;
     &lt;META name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"
     &lt;title&gt;Sample web page&lt;/title&gt;
     &lt;/head&gt;
     &lt;body&gt;
     <br>
     <em>(contents go here)

     </em>
     &lt;/body&gt;
     &lt;/html&gt;
  </pre>
</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
      The first line (DOCTYPE) specifies which language the page uses (<a href="#">HTML</a> = Hypertext Markup Language); just copy this line. The next line, &lt;html&gt;, starts the page, and is matched by the last line, &lt;html&gt;, which closes the page. &lt;head&gt;, starts the heading, which contains a title to be displayed on the browser's title bar and a declaration of the character set (nowadays it should always be <a href="#">UTF-8</a>) and the "viewport" line which is a compulsory adaptation for cell phones, "smart" watches, etc. &lt;head&gt; closes the heading.

      The &lt;body&gt; tag starts the body of the document, is closed by &lt;body&gt; tag.
  </p>
  <p>
      As you can see, most HTML commands come in begin-end pairs: &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;head&gt;...&gt;/head&gt;, etc. The closing part of the command has a slash (/) between the &lt; and the first letter of the command.

  </p>
  <p>
      Blank lines and line breaks are ignored. The browser automatically "flows" your text into lines and paragraphs that fit in its window. Paragraphs must be separated by &lt;p&gt;. Line breaks can be forced by &lt;br&gt;.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Examples of Windows:</em>
    <blockquote>
    <pre>
      <span class="tt"> Use the mouse to copy the HTML above into NotePad. Then save the file (File -&gt; Save As...) in your Web directory as index.html. Suppose your Windows username is Olga. Then (depending on which version of Windows you have) this might be:
        <pre>C:\Documents and Settings\Olga\Desktop\Web\index.html</pre>
        Now to see your new web page, just double-click on the Web folder and then double-click on index.html.

    </pre>
  </blockquote>
    <p>
        Now you're ready to start adding "content" to your web page. Go back to NotePad and replace the title and "(Contents go here)" with whatever you want. Any time you want to see the result, use File -> Save in NotePad and then click the Reload button on your browser.

        The next sections tell how to achieve different kinds of effects.

    <h3>3. Special characters</h3>
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML special "character entities" start with ampersand (&) and end with semicolon (;), like "&amp;euro;" = "&euro;". The ever-popular "no-break space" is &nbsp;. There are special entity names for accented Latin letters and other West European special characters such as:
    <!-- secondary material used here. Not really perfect with this phase down -->
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <table border >
      <tr>
        <td>&amp;auml;</td>
        <td>&amp;a-umlaut</td>
        <td>&nbsp; &auml;</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&amp;Auml;</td>
        <td>A-umlaut</td>
        <td>&nbsp; &Auml;</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&amp;aacute;</td>
        <td>a-acute</td>
        <td>&nbsp;&aacute;</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&amp;agrave;</td>
        <td>a-grave</td>
        <td>&nbsp; &aacute;</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&amp;ntilde;</td>
        <td>n-tilde</td>

      </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>
      <p>Examples</p>
      <p>For <strong>Spanish</strong> you would need:</p>
      <blockquote>
        &amp;Aacute; (&Aacute;), &amp;aacute; (&aacute;), &amp;Eacute; (&Eacute;), &amp;eacute; (&eacute;), &amp;Iacute; (&Iacute;), &amp;iacute; (&iacute;), &amp;Oacute; (&Oacute;), &amp;oacute; (&oacute;), &amp;Uacute; (&Uacute;), &amp;uacute; (&uacute;), &amp;Ntilde; (&Ntilde;),&amp;ntilde; (&ntilde;), &amp;iquest; (&iquest;), &amp;iexcl; (&iquest;). <br>
        Example: A&ntilde;orar&aacute;n=A&amp;ntilde;orar&amp;aacute;n.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        For <strong>German</strong> you would need
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        &amp;Auml; (&Aacute;), &amp;auml; (&aacute;), &amp;Ouml; (&Oacute;), &amp;ouml; (&oacute;), &amp;Uuml; (&uacute;), &amp;szlig; (&szlig;),<br>
        Examples: Gr&uacute;&szlig;e aus K&oacute;ln=<small>Gr&amp;uuml;&amp;szlig;e aus k&amp;ouml;ln.</small>
      </blockquote>
      <!-- End here! -->
      <p><a href="#">CLICK HERE</a>for a complete list. When the page encoding is <a href="#">UTF-8</a>, which is recommended, you can also enter any character at all, Roman, Cyrillic, Arabic, Hebrew, Greek. Japanese, etc, either as numeric entities or (if you have a way to type them) directly from the keyboard.</p>
      <p>
          And remember: if you want to include &lt;, &, or &gt; literally in text to be displayed, you have to write &amp;lt;, &amp;, amp;gt;, respectively.

<h3> 4. Converting Plain text to HTML </h3>
    </p>
    <p>
   If you have a plain text file that you want to convert to HTML, load the file into a plain-text editor and then follow these steps.
   <ol>
   <li>Change all occurences of "&amp;" to "&amp;amp;".</li>
   <li>Change all occurence of "&lt;" to "&amp;lt;".</li>
   <li>Change all occurence of "&gt;" to "&amp;gt;"</li>
   <li>Change any accented letter to HTML entity names(previous section)</li>
   <li>Put "&lt;p&gt;" between each paragraph</li>
    <li>Insert the standard prolog at the top, substituting an appropriate tittle.</li>
    <li>Insert the standard epilog at the bottom.</li>
          <li>Save the result as <em>xxx.html,</em>where <em>xxx</em> is the part of the original file's name before the dot. For example, if the original file was <em>letter.txt,</em> save the edited version as <em>letter.html.</em> </li>
          <br>
          <p>
             if you are a <a href="#">Kermit</a> user,you can find a script to convert plain text to HTML <a href="#">HERE</a>
          </p>
          <p>If the text contains lists, tables, or other structures, read on.</p>
          <p>If you have a Microsoft Word document you want to convert to HTML, and your copy of Word does not allow the file to be "Saved As" HTML, then save it as plain text and follow the same instructions. In this case you lose the "richness" (bold, italics, font changes, etc) when you save the file, and will have to put the effects back by hand (next section).
            </p>

              <h3>5. Effects</h3>
            </p>
            <p>The rest of this document shows some of what you can do with simple HTML commands, but I don't explain how to do it. To see that, just tell your browser to <strong> View Source</strong> and compare the HTML in the source window with the result in the original window.</p>

               <ul>
                 <li>This is a List Item(&lt;li&gt;).</li>

               </ol>
               <p>And here is a Description List (&lt;dl&gt;). using Kermit commands as an example:</p>

                 <dt>SET FILE TYPE BINARY 
                   
                   <dd>This command tells Kermit to transfer files in binary mode. In other words, don't mess with the file, just send it as-is. The result on the receiving computer should be identical to the original.</dd>
                 </dt>
                 </p>
                 <p>SET FILE TYPE TEXT 
                   <blockquote>This command tells Kermit to transfer files in text mode. This should be used with plain-text files, especially when transferring them between computers with different file formats or operating systems, such as VMS and Unix, or Unix and Windows. It converts the file's format and character-set (if necessary) so the received file is usable on the destination computer.</blockquote>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    You can have lists within lists:

                     <li>A doohickey.</li>
                     <li>A veeblefetzer -- these come in several colors:

                 <p>
                    How to put your web page on the Internet depends on your Internet Service Provider (ISP). At Columbia University, each user has a "shell account" on the central server, which runs a Unix-based operating system, and which you can access with a terminal emulator such as <a href="#">Kermit.</a>  Here's an example that applies to Columbia University's web server, showing how to upload your files from Windows:
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                   <em> There are easier ways to do this than what I describe below, but they require add-on software. The following method should work for everybody who has Windows and an Internet connection.</em>

                 <p>
                    If you create a public_html subdirectory of your login directory, give it "world" read and search permission, and then create an <small>index.html</small>  file in that directory and give it world read permission, you'll have a home page. In this example "&dollar;" is the shell prompt (yours might be different), and what you type is underlined. CAUTION: the directory name is <small>public_html</small>  but the underscore might be obscured the underline in the examples below. Whenenever typing <small>"public_html"</small>  always include the underscore. CAUTION#2: Some Web hosting sites might use different a different name for the user's Web directory.

                    You only have to do this part once.

                 <p>
                    Let's assume you have created a website in the Web folder on your PC. Here's an example of how to upload your Web files to your public_html directory on Columbia University's Cunix server using FTP (File Transfer Protocol). First start the FTP program:
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   <blockquote>
                     <i>start</i> &nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;<i>run</i>
                   </blockquote>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    and type "ftp" in the box. An FTP window opens and an "ftp&gt;" prompt appears. Type the underlined commands at the "ftp&gt;" prompt (substituting your own user ID, etc):
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   <blockquote>

                </blockquote>
                   <p>
                      This sends the <small>index.html</small>  file to your public_html directory on the server. You can send any other file by substituting its name for <small>"index.html.</small>  If you want to send all the files in your Web folder, replace "put <small>index.html</small>  with "put *" (asterisk, meaning "all files" in this directory). Always use binary mode unless you know what you're doing.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                      If the "site chmod" command failed (this service is not supported by some FTP servers), you have one more step. Before others can see your web files, you have to give them "world read" permission. Again, log in to the server using a terminal emulator (Telnet, SSH, Kermit, whatever), and:
                   </p>
                   <blockquote>
                     <pre>
                       &dollar; <u>cd~/public html  (Enter the public_html subdirectory)</u>
                       &dollar; <u>chmod 664 *      (Make all files publically readable)</u>
                     </pre>
                   </blockquote>
                   <p>
                      Now you have a home page. If you were at Columbia and your login ID was "olga", the address (URL) of your home page would be:

                   <p>
                      If you want to add pictures to your Web page, you can upload those too (also with Kermit or FTP), and you also have to "chmod 664" all the files to make them readable by everybody. Every time you add new files to your <small>public_html </small> directory, you have to "chmod 664" them so they are accessible, either in the FTP session itself (as shown previously), or by logging in to the host and:
                   </p>
                   <blockquote>
                     <pre>

                   <p>
                      Pictures should be in JPG or GIF format. To include a picture ("image") in your page, include a sequence like this at the desired spot:
                   </p>
                   <blockquote>
                     <pre>
                     &lt;img scr"filename" alt="brief description"&gt;
                    </pre>
                   </blockquote>
                   <p>
                      Replace <i> filename</i> by the name of the file <i>(e.g. skyline.jpg).</i> 
                     Almost every HTML tag can be customized by "attributes" in the begin tag. For example if you want the image to scale itself to the viewer's window (on a computer, cell phone, or other device), and furthermore you want the text of the page to flow around it, you can do:
                   </p>
                   <blockquote>
                     <pre>
                        &lt;img alt="brief description"
                        style="width:50%; max-width:500px; float:left; margin:10px;"
                        src="filename"&gt;
                     </pre>
                   </blockquote>
                   <p>
                      You can look up the attributes in Google, just search for <i>html width, html float, etc.</i> 
                   </p>
                   <p>
                      Now you have your own home page on the Web, and your own URL (Uniform Resource Locator, or Web address). In this example, the URL is:
                   </p>
                   <blockquote>
                     <pre>
                       <a href="#">http://www.columbia.edu/~olga/</a>
                     </pre>

                   <p>
                      Of course, if you prefer, you can also do all the Web-page editing directly on the server, using an a server-based text editor like EMACS, Pico, or Vi while logged in to the Unix shell. In that case you don't need to upload anything (except maybe photos), but then you also need to be more familiar with the server's Unix environment and commands and utilities.

                      Most Web pages are created by hideous bloated "Web Authoring" tools, which are usually designed to hook you (and readers of your web pages) into some corporate profit-making scheme. If all you want is text with some pictures and links and maybe some tables, as opposed to spinning blinking popup holograms with streaming video and sound effects, it's best to keep it simple and do it yourself. This is how the Web started off in the HTML 1.0 days of the early 1990s. The ingenious thing was that it was self propogating. If you saw a web page with a certain effect and wanted to know how it was done, you could simply "view source" to get the "source code" and then adapt it to your own page. You can still do that with pages that look like this one, but since most Web pages are no longer made by hand, you'll often see tons of incomprehensible gibberish (the more special effects, the more gibberish).
                   </p>
                   <p>
                      Anyway, if you have mastered the simple techniques shown in this page, you know the basics. Which is more than can be said of many "web designers" who only know how to use prepackaged software to create web pages by picking things from menus and moving things around with a mouse.
                   </p>

                     The <a href="#">HTML 5.2 specification</a> (2017)</li>
                     <li><a href="#">Cascading style sheets</a> (yet another "standard" layered on top of HTML, which, like HTML goes through many versions, each one making the previous on obsolete).</li>
                     <li>You can check the validity of your web page at the <a href="#">W3C Markup Validation Service.</a>  Note that this page itself does not pass the Validator because it uses a number of "obsolete" elements. That's because (a) they are much easier to explain, and (b) they still work.</li>
                     <li>You can find lots more Web pages in the same simple style as this one at the <a href="#">Kermit Project</a>  website and the <a href="#"> New York City New Deal website.</a></li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>
                      And finally, bear in mind: what is "best practice" today quickly becomes "obsolete" and "depracated". Standards aren't really standards if they change all the time, are they?
